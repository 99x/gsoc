# Contributing Guidelines - 99X Technology

Welcome to 99X Technology Open Source community. Please follow these simple guidelines when you make contributions. :)

# How to contribute

## When you want to start on something we need

Check out our `help-wanted` label to find issues we want to move forward on with your help.

In there you will find different issues that we think are important and need some help with. If you're just starting to contribute and you are a beginner you might want to check out the `easy` or `beginner` labels first, but as an experienced developer the `help-wanted` should be fine as well. The difference is mostly in how much time the tasks will take to implement. Thanks for helping us with those, we really appreciate it.

## When you want to propose a new feature or bug fix
* Please make sure there is an open issue discussing your Contribution.
* If there isn't, please open an issue so we can talk about it before you invest time into the Implementation.
* When creating an issue follow the guide that Github shows so we have enough information about your proposal.

## Pull Requests
Please follow these Pull Request guidelines when creating Pull Requests:
* If an Issue exists, leave a comment there that you are working on a solution so nobody else jumps on it.
* If an Issue does not exist, create a new Issue, detail your changes.  We recommend waiting until we accept it, so you don't waste your precious time.
* Follow **Code Style** guidelines below.
* Start commit messages with a lowercase verb such as "add", "fix", "refactor", "remove".
* Submit your PR and make sure the Travis-CI builds don't fail and the code coverage isn't lowered.
* Reference the issue in your PR.

## Issues
Please follow these Issue guidelines for opening Issues:
* Make sure your Issue is not a duplicate.
* Make sure your Issue is for a *feature request*, *bug report*, or *a discussion about a relevant topic*. For the rest, please use Gitter channel to discuss.

### Code Style
We aim for clean, consistent code style.  We're using ESlint to check for codestyle issues using the Airbnb preset. If ESlint issues are found our build will fail and we can't merge the PR.  To help reduce the effort of creating contributions with this style, an [.editorconfig file](http://editorconfig.org/) is provided that your editor may use to override any conflicting global defaults and automate a subset of the style settings.  You may need to enable EditorConfig's use by changing a setting or installing a plugin.  Using it is not compulsory.

## Providing Support
The easiest thing you can do to help us move forward and make an impact on our progress is to simply provide support to other people having difficulties with our projects. You can do that by replying to issues on Github, chatting with other community members in Gitter or helping with questions in mailing list.

## Improving Documentation
Maintaining and updating the docs on a regular basis is a hard task. The more eyeballs on the docs the higher quality it'll get and the less chances there will be for typos and confusion. If you see any issues with our docs, simply open an issue or a PR.

## Our Code of Conduct
Finally, to make sure you have a pleasant experience while being in our welcoming community, please read our [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md). It outlines our core values and believes and will make working together a happier experience.
